# Discussion

This study used an experimental survey to examine Europeans' perceptions of the fairness of different mechanisms for distributing asylum applications among EU countries. By varying the information provided about the consequences of these mechanisms, it explored the extent to which public perceptions of fairness are driven by concerns about outcomes versus principles of fairness.

Consistent with prior research [@bansak2017europeans], we find that a substantial majority (76%) of respondents across eight EU countries view some form of proportional relocation of applicants as *fairer* than no relocation at all. Moreover, most people view proportional relocation systems as *fairer* even when it would result in their own country receiving more asylum applications, as the share of those ranking relocation as fairer than no relocation exceeds 50% in all countries.

Yet, we find substantial variation in fairness perceptions across countries. In the control group, where no information about the outcomes was provided, we find that between 58% respondents in Germany to 87% respondents in Greece view some form of within-EU relocation as fairer than no relocation at all. This gap could be partly explained by concerns about the outcomes. For instance, a border country like Greece would experience more applications under a no relocation system, while Germany would experience fewer applications. This finding underscores the importance of disentangling concerns about outcomes from fairness.

@bansak2017europeans finds that varying the information available about outcomes significantly affects public support for different relocation systems. Building on this insight, our research demonstrates that providing information about the consequences is key in shaping public perceptions of the fairness of these systems. Thus, our study establishes a direct link between political support identified by @bansak2017europeans and the perceived fairness of different policy options. As such, our study adds to a growing literature exploring the role of public perceptions of fairness in regulation, such as @brick2015fair for climate regulation.

By providing information about the consequences of the allocation schemes, we find that when individuals learn about the outcomes, the initial preference for proportional schemes is offset if the relocation mechanism results in one standard deviation more asylum applications. In other words, Europeans are more likely to perceive proportional allocation systems as fair when the increase in the number of asylum seekers implied by these systems is not too large. A first key takeaway is that information matters: receiving information about the consequences of proportional mechanisms may alter perceptions of fairness, ultimately shaping public support for relocation policies.

Another key implication is that framing matters. Differences that appear large in absolute terms may seem small when presented in relative terms. Indeed, in our randomised experiment, we find that expressing the outcomes of different relocation systems in absolute numbers leads some individuals to react more strongly to the information. When no information is provided, a regime that increases expected asylum applications by one standard deviation is 13% less likely to be seen as fair. Once information is revealed, fairness drops by 40% with relative information and by 56% with absolute information. Thus, providing absolute information produces an additional 16-percentage point decrease in perceived fairness compared to relative information. This finding highlights another way in which public opinion can be influenced by the framing of identical information.

Our analysis of heterogeneous effects provides additional evidence on the mechanisms through which absolute vs relative information works. These differing impacts are not uniform across the population but are highly dependent on individual factors, including political orientation and demographics. Across most education groups, we find a consistently negative and statistically significant correlation between the number of asylum seekers and perceived fairness. The magnitude of this association was larger in the absolute-information group, moderate in the relative-information group, and modest in the control group. However, the effect of asylum seekers was weakest for low-educated respondents in all groups. These findings suggest a minor sensitivity of low-educated individuals to information. With regard to political orientation, both GDP- and population-based relocation schemes were consistently viewed as fairer than no relocation, with the largest effects observed for left-leaning respondents under absolute and control conditions.

<!-- These findings extend @bansak2017europeans's information provision experiment in two ways. First, we investigate the role of framing information between relative and absolute figures. Secondly, we investigate more closely the perceptions of fairness, rather than public support for the policy. This novel evidence also adds to a growing literature exploring the role of public perceptions of fairness in regulation, such as @brick2015fair for climate regulation.  -->

Our research relates to conspicuous experimental literature in other fields that has shown the sensitivity of human decision-making to absolute vs relative values [@malenka1993framing; @kratochvil2024fallacy]. In medical research, for example, effect sizes or risk reductions of interventions may appear very large or quite small, depending on the use of relative or absolute measures on the same dataset [@malenka1993framing]. The use of relative risk reduction has been shown to be more likely to influence the decision to accept a treatment than absolute risk reduction. In political communication, the main reason why relative values are so widespread is that absolute values are mostly not of much use for comparison among countries because they vary in population size. It is worth noticing, however, that the use of relative information may lead to misleading conclusions [@silva2020per]. They should, therefore, be used when the measure of interest increases proportionally with population size. Our study provides additional evidence on the effect of relative vs absolute communication in the field of migration policies.

This study has some key limitations. As the evidence is survey-based, the findings rely on self-reported attitudes and are susceptible to biases such as social desirability or a gap between stated and actual behaviour. The scope of the research is also geographically constrained: drawing data from eight countries limits the generalizability of the results to global or even broader regional contexts. Finally, the use of hypothetical scenarios, though necessary for experimental control, means that the observed reactions to absolute versus relative information may not perfectly translate to real-world policy decisions.
