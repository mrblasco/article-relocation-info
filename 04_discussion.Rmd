# Discussion

This study used an experimental survey to examine Europeans’ perceptions of the fairness of different mechanisms for distributing asylum applications among EU countries. By varying the information provided about the consequences of these mechanisms, it explored the extent to which public perceptions of fairness are driven by concerns about outcomes versus principles of fairness.

Consistent with prior research [@bansak2017europeans], we find that a substantial majority (76%) of respondents across eight EU countries view some form of proportional relocation of applicants as *fairer* than no relocation at all. Moreover, most people view proportional relocation systems as *fairer* even when it would result in their own country receiving more asylum applications, as the share of those ranking relocation as fairer than no relocation exceeds 50% in all countries.

Yet, we find substantial variation in fairness perceptions across countries. In the control group, where no information about the outcomes was provided, we find that between 58% respondents in Germany to 87% respondents in Greece view some form of within-EU relocation as fairer than no relocation at all. This gap could be partly explained by concerns about the outcomes. For instance, a border country like Greece would experience more applications under a no relocation system, while Germany would experience fewer applications. This finding underscores the importance of disentangling concerns about outcomes from fairness. 

@bansak2017europeans finds that varying the information available about outcomes significantly affects public support for different relocation systems. Building on this insight, our researrch demonstrates that providing information about the consequences is key in shaping public perceptions of the fairness of these systems. Thus, our study establishes a direct link between political support identified by @bansak2017europeans and the perceived fairness of different policy options.

Specifically, by providing information about the consequences of the allocation schemes, we find that when individuals receive information about the outcome, the initial preference for proportional schemes is completely offest if the relocation mechanism results in about one standard deviation more asylum applications. In other words, Europeans are more likely to perceive proportional allocation systems as fair when the rise in the number of asylum seekers implied by these systems is not too large. 

<!-- The key takeaway is that the expected number of asylum seekers influence perceptions of fairness and, consequently, support for different allocation systems. That is, one can influence public opinion by shaping how large or small outcome differences are perceived.  -->

Another key results of our study lies in the effects of how the consequences of different relocation schemes are communicated. In fact, differences that appear large in absolute terms may seem small in relative terms. Building on this observation, our experimental design examines the effect of presenting the number of asylum applications in relative (per capita) vs absolute terms. As a result, we find that by expressing outcomes of different relocation systems in absolute terms, some people react more strongly to this information.

Specifically, when no information is provided about the expected number of asylum applications under each regime, a regime associated with a one–standard deviation increase in expected asylum applications is 13% less likely to be perceived as fair. However, once information is revealed, this effect becomes stronger: the probability of being perceived as fair drops by 40% when relative information is shown, and by 56% when absolute levels of expected asylum applications are presented. Thus, providing absolute information produces an additional 16–percentage point decrease in perceived fairness compared to relative information. 

This finding extends @bansak2017europeans's information provision experiment, where information was presented in absolute terms. This evidence also adds to a growing literature exploring the role of public perceptions of fairness in regulation [e.g., @brick2015fair for climate regulation]. 

Our analysis of heterogeneous effects provides additional evidence on the mechanisms through which absolute vs relative information work. These differing impacts are not uniform across the population but are highly dependent on individual factors, including political orientation, and demographics. Across most education groups, we find a consistently negative and statistically significant correlation between the number of asylum seekers and perceived fairness. The magnitude of this association was larger in the absolute-information group, moderate in the relative-information group, and modest in the control group. However, the effect of asylum seekers was weakest for low-educated respondents in all groups. These findings suggest a minor sensitivity of low-educated individuals to information. With regard to political orientation, both GDP- and population-based relocation schemes were consistently viewed as fairer than no relocation, with the largest effects observed for left-leaning respondents under absolute and control conditions.

Our research relates to conspicuous experimental literature in other fields that has shown the sensitivity of human decision-making to absolute vs relative values (@Witte et al. 2021; @Kratochvíl and Havlíček). In medical research, for example, effect sizes or risk reductions of interventions may appear very large or quite small, depending on the use of relative or absolute measures on the same dataset (@Witte et al. 2021). The use of relative risk reduction has been shown to be more likely to influence the decision to accept a treatment than absolute risk reduction. The main reason why relative values are so widespread is that absolute values are mostly not of much use for comparison among countries because they vary in their population size. It is worth, however, noticing that the use of relative information may lead to misleading conclusions (@Silva, 2020). They should, therefore, be used when the measure of interest increases proportionally with population size. Our study provides additional evidence on the effect of relative vs absolute communication in the field of migration policies.

This study has to some key limitations. As the evidence is survey-based, the findings rely on self-reported attitudes and are susceptible to biases such as social desirability or a gap between stated and actual behavior. The scope of the research is also geographically constrained, drawing data from only eight countries, which limits the generalizability of the results to global or even broader regional contexts. Finally, the use of hypothetical scenarios—though necessary for experimental control—means that the observed reactions to absolute versus relative information may not perfectly translate to real-world policy decisions.
