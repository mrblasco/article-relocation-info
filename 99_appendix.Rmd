## Regression model for the fairness rankings

We used a rank-ordered logit model [e.g., @hausman1987specifying] to estimate the effect of a change in the expected number of asylum seekers under a relocation scheme on the probability of ranking the scheme higher in the fairness ranking. This model allows probabilities to depend on the differences among all alternatives in a latent "fairness" variable. We assume the latent variable to be a function of the expected asylum seekers (scaled), $AS$, and we allow the coefficients to vary by treatment. This variable can be formulated as:
\[
    \mu_{ij}^{\tau} = \alpha_{j}^{\tau} + \beta_{j}^{\tau} \text{AS},
\]
for all $i$ and $j$ alternatives, with $\alpha_{j}^{\tau}$ and $\beta_{j}^{\tau}$ set to zero for an arbitrary alternative and an arbitrary treatment condition $\tau$. We selected the no-relocation scheme as the reference alternative, and the reference treatment group is the absolute-information group, so the model yields estimates of differences between control vs absolute and absolute vs relative information.
