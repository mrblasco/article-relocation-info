# Introduction

Over the past decade, the EU's asylum and migration system has been severely tested, from the 2015 escalation of the Syrian war to the recent conflict in Ukraine. These events exposed a disproportionate pressure placed on Member States at the EU's external borders. In response, the EU adopted the Pact on Migration and Asylum in May 2024, which establishes a permanent solidarity framework among Member States.

Under the Pact, the country of first entry remains responsible for asylum applications, while *all* Member States commit to support the system through solidarity contributions, including the relocation of applicants or beneficiaries, financial contributions, or other operational support.^[See @eu2024pact] However, there is no consensus among countries on how this responsibility should be shared. Because the implementation of solidarity mechanisms ultimately depends on political support at the national level, understanding public perceptions of fairness and solidarity in the EU asylum and migration system is crucial for ensuring the solidarity framework functions effectively, and maintaining social cohesion across the EU.

To explore these perceptions, we conducted an experimental survey in eight EU countries. Respondents were asked to evaluate the fairness of alternative asylum-seekers relocation systems under different information conditions about the consequences of each mechanism. Specifically, the survey asked respondents to rank the fairness of three mechanisms: no relocation, allocation proportional to each country's GDP, and allocation proportional to each country's population. 

As in @bansak2017europeans, we compared responses from those who received information about the consequences of implementing each method for the respondent's country, against those with no such information. Extending this approach, we additionally vary how consequences are communicated, presenting them either in *absolute* terms or *relative* to the country’s population. This distinction is important because absolute figures may exaggerate perceived burdens, while relative measures better capture per-capita responsibility and may lead to different fairness judgments.

Our work builds on a large body of literature showing that people tend to combine several fairness principles, such as need, deservingness, or reciprocity, when judging distributional outcomes [@konow2003fairest]. However, when one's own stakes are salient, a self-serving bias can shift those judgements so that the option that benefits agents the most appears "fairest" [@babcock1995biased; @konow2000fair]. This tension between "distributional fairness" and "self-serving tendency" appears particularly relevant when considering international solidarity in the asylum system. On the one hand, the principle of fairness suggests that countries should share migrants proportionally to their capacity. On the other hand, self-serving biases may lead to prioritising national interest. However, despite pioneering work by @bansak2017europeans to understand this issue, how these views shape public perceptions of fairness in the migration system is still poorly understood.

<!-- Prior research has also shown that a large majority of Europeans support mechanisms for redistributing asylum applications across EU countries, such as proportional relocation schemes based on a country's population or economic capacity [@bansak2017europeans]. However, it is unclear to what extent such support is based on a principle of fairness or on self-interest, as citizens may view a proportional system as more advantageous for them regardless of fairness. It is also unclear how current perceptions are influenced by the available information, and how such information should be communicated to citizens. This study advances the field by exploring to what extent public perceptions of the fairness of different relocation systems are shaped by own-country consequences by varying the *type* of available information on the expected asylum seekers under each system. -->

We find that nearly three-quarters of participants find some form of relocation most fair. However, there are important country differences. These are consistent with a self-serving bias: the tendency to judge the method that results in relatively few asylum seekers in one's own country as fairer. Moreover, communication strategies randomised as treatments significantly moderate this tendency. Explicitly spelling out the likely consequences of the implementation of each method in absolute terms (how many asylum seekers are expected in the participants' country per year) significantly strengthens the self-serving bias. The same information presented in relative terms (how many asylum seekers are to be expected per 100,000 inhabitants), showing that the number of asylum seekers is small compared to the entire population, has a weaker effect.

The EU Pact on Migration and Asylum is designed to manage the complex issue of migration more effectively. Its key component is the relocation system, aiming to create a fairer and more predictable process than the previous rules. The relocation of asylum seekers has been subject to increased controversy. This issue has fuelled significant political and social tensions for several reasons, including an uneven distribution whereby border countries bear most responsibility for processing asylum claims. Other EU member states were often unwilling to accept a share of these asylum seekers, leading to a major imbalance in burden-sharing [@thielemann2018refugee]. The issue has become a powerful tool for populist and far-right political parties across Europe, using anti-immigrant rhetoric to mobilise voters and gain political power [@dinas2019waking; @halla2017immigration].

Despite an intense political debate about asylum-seekers' relocation, there is still little evidence on Europeans' preferences. Survey evidence indicates that Europeans favour capacity-based relocation over both the Dublin "first-entry" rule and financial transfers. The seminal paper of @bansak2017europeans, using a survey with 18,000 respondents across 15 EU+ countries, shows that 72% of respondents backed proportional allocation even after learning it would raise their own country's intake. Similarly, a 26-country experiment by @cappelen2023trade showed that most people prefer admitting asylum seekers to paying host states. A cross-national conjoint study in eight EU countries found that citizens favour refugee protection paired with clear limits or conditions, rather than pure first-entry allocations [@jeannet2021asylum]. Existing research, hence, suggests that public preferences are more nuanced and conditional than commonly assumed. Recent UK-based findings by @corre2024extent particularly highlight this complexity. They used a conjoint experiment to test whether current UK asylum policies align with public desire. Their results challenge the common belief that the public uniformly favours stricter policies than those currently in place. These results strongly suggest that to truly understand public preferences, researchers must disaggregate complex immigration policies into their specific components, moving beyond treating asylum as a single issue.

Citizens' widespread support for distributing asylum seekers based on a country's capacity implies a belief in the principle of proportional fairness and the equitable sharing of responsibility. However, this does not rule out that self-interest also shapes their attitudes, as some studies suggest. @bansak2017europeans found that the large majority of citizens favour an allocation policy proportional to each country's capacity over the status quo of allocation based on the country of first entry. This majority support, though weakened, persists even when respondents are informed that proportional allocation would increase the number of asylum seekers sent to their own country. These findings suggest that citizens care deeply about the fairness of the process. 

@heizmann2020willing analyses Eurobarometer data and finds that people living in countries that have taken in more asylum seekers and immigrants in the past are especially supportive of policies that redistribute wealth or resources, a preference they link to a mix of self-interest, concerns for their country's collective well-being, and moral values. Experimental work in Norway and Israel demonstrates that establishing clear proportional-allocation rules can mitigate NIMBYism (acronym for the "not in my back yard" attitude) by framing redistribution of refugees as a civic duty rather than an imposed burden [@solodoch2024overburdened]. U.S. evidence from conjoint analysis further confirms that admission decisions are based more on collective good and ethical standards than on individual economic gain [@hainmueller2015hidden].

Furthermore, a growing body of research confirms that public attitudes toward migration policy are malleable and can be meaningfully shifted through the use of concrete information and tailored framing. Studies show that specific informational framings can influence policy support: for example, informing U.S. respondents about the administrative burdens of legal immigration boosts support for more open policies [@kustov2025immigration]. Similarly, messaging congruent with personal values (using the @schwartz1992universals framework) proves more persuasive than generic humanitarian appeals in European campaigns [@dennison2020basic], and correcting misperceptions about immigration's labour-market impact increases and sustains public support [@haaland2020labor]. In addition, narratives based on demographic challenges—such as focusing on labour shortages or an ageing population—can raise pro-immigration attitudes and political action [@facchini2022countering]. Conversely, @bansak2017europeans found that providing consequences-focused information (specifically, revealing that a proportional policy would increase asylum seeker numbers in a respondent's own country) appeared to boost self-interest, thereby slightly weakening support for the fairness-based proportional relocation in those countries where proportionality and self-interest don't align. @cappelen2023second observed a self-serving bias where respondents deemed an allocation method fairer if it resulted in a lower national intake. 

Drawing on the literature presented, we posit two core expectations (see the AEA RCT Registry for details). First, support for a proportional allocation system will be high: in each treatment, the share of participants considering the "no relocation" status quo as fairest will be significantly below the benchmark of one-third of all participants. Second, the perceived fairness of an option will negatively depend on the expected number of asylum seekers in one's own country under this option communicated to participants (self-serving bias). Specifically, consistent with research showing people overestimate migrant populations [@alesina2023immigration], we expect self-serving bias to be more pronounced when the consequences are presented in absolute terms (thousands) compared to relative terms (hundreds per 100,000 inhabitants). This means that where a given relocation policy reduces the national burden with respect to the status quo (which is true for countries currently receiving a disproportionately high number of asylum applications), we predict that the policy will be rated as significantly fairer in the information treatments. Conversely, in countries in which a proportional policy increases the national burden, we predict that the policy will be rated as significantly less fair in the information treatments. In all cases, we expect that the detrimental or beneficial self-serving effect will be strongest when the information is presented in absolute terms rather than relative terms. This prediction is based on the literature suggesting that the same social effect presented in absolute rather than relative terms might be perceived as larger, affecting policy preferences [@pedersen2017ratio], a manifestation of the more general phenomenon of denominator neglect [@reyna2008numeracy].

This work contributes to the literature on how public perceptions of fairness influence policy acceptance. Policy acceptance across all sectors depends on citizens viewing them as fair. Fairness judgments about who deserves what and perceptions about whether incomes reflect effort versus circumstances are strong correlates of redistributive preferences [@van2000should; @van2006making;@fong2001social; @corneo2002individual; @fong2011fairness; @durante2014preferences; @almaas2010fairness; @cappelen2023trade]. Information can influence support, but its effects are heterogeneous: mobility information raises support (especially for opportunity policies), while inequality information mostly shifts concern and has large policy effects chiefly for the estate tax [@kuziemko2015elastic; @alesina2023immigration]. In climate policy, support for carbon pricing rises when revenues are allocated in ways seen as fair, and acceptance can be improved with clear and trustworthy information on the policy's impact [@carattini2019win; @maestre2019perceived]. 

Our study also adds to the literature in behavioural economics and decision making, which aims to understand how people respond to different ways of framing information. Work in medical research, for instance, has shown that people respond differently to risks when they are presented in absolute versus relative terms [@malenka1993framing]. Our work bridges these insights from medical and behavioural science literature and embeds them within a migration policy context.
