# Introduction

Over the past decade, the EU's asylum and migration system has been severely tested by several cri-ses, starting with the 2015-2016 sharp increase in migrants driven by conflicts in the Middle East and Africa (European Parliament, 2025), and more recently by the war in Ukraine. To address such chal-lenges, the European Commission has adopted a pact on migration and asylum in 2024 that aims to harmonise the reception of asylum seekers in the EU. One of the Pact's  primary goals is to foster greater solidarity among the EU Member States (Sweeney, 2024) and address the disproportionate bur-den on border states that the existing Dublin regulation failed to resolve (Bansak et al., 2017). The new mandatory but flexible solidarity mechanism allows Member States to contribute via relocation of asylum seekers, financial or operational support.

Against this backdrop, understanding how the public defines a “fair share” of responsibility is crucial. How do Europeans judge alternative relocation mechanisms? Are judgements driven primarily by antici-pated domestic consequences, or by solidarity and fairness principles? How do these perceptions vary across countries that, despite being similar in many respects, differ so widely in terms of economic ca-pacity and population size? Our study aims to address these questions via an experimental survey that asks citizens of eight EU countries to evaluate the fairness of different systems, while varying the type and availability of information about the consequences of each mechanism. This experimental design helps to disentangle concerns about outcomes from fairness.

Prior research has shown that a large majority of Europeans support mechanisms for redistributing asy-lum applications across EU countries, such as proportional relocation schemes based on country’s population or economic capacity (Bansak et al. (2017)). However, it is unclear to what extent such sup-port is based on a principle of fairness or on self –interest, as citizens may view a proportional system as more advantageous for them regardless of fairness. It is also unclear how current perceptions are influenced by the available information, and how such information should be communicated or presented to citizens. This study advances the field by exploring if and to what extent public perceptions of fairness of different relocation systems are shaped by own-country consequences (self-serving bias) by varying the type and amount of the available information on the expected asylum seekers under each system, .


To address these questions, our experimental survey asked respondents to rank fairness of three methods of allocating asylum seekers: no relocation, allocation proportional to each country’s GDP, and allocation proportional to each country’s population. We find that nearly three-quarters of participants find some form of relocation most fair. However, there are important country differences. These are con-sistent with a self-serving bias: the tendency to judge the method that results in relatively fewer asylum seekers in one’s own country as fairer. Moreover, communication strategies randomised as treatments significantly moderate this tendency. Explicitly spelling out the likely consequences of implementation of each method in absolute terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected in partici-pants’ country per year) significantly strengthens the self-serving bias. The same information presented in relative terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected per 100,000 inhabitants), showing that the number of asylum seekers is generally small, has a weaker effect.


This work contributes to the literature on public perceptions of fairness of policies that goes beyond mi-gration policy. In climate research, […]. In medical research, […]

Our study also adds to the literature in behavioural economics and decision making that aims to under-stand how people respond to different ways of framing information. Work in medical research, for in-stance, has shown that people respond differently to risks when they are presented in absolute versus relative terms. For example, research shows that patients are more likely to follow a prescribed cure when they are informed of relative risks (e.g. doubles your risk) rather than absolute risks (e.g., your risk is 2%) (REF). In medicine, these effects are often explained by people’s tendency to use heuristics (cognitive bias) or education, especially poor numerical literacy [REFs]. Our work bridges these insights from medical and behavioural science literature and embeds them within a migration policy context.

In this context, it is important to understand how communication of the information interact with political orientation, pre-defined beliefs about migration, knowledge or awareness of the migration system.
