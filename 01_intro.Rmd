# Introduction

Over the past decade, the EU's asylum and migration system has been severely tested by multiple major events, starting with a sharp increase in migrants driven by the escalation of the Syrian war in 2015 and, more recently, by the war in Ukraine in 2022. To address such challenges, the European Union has adopted the New Pact on Migration and Asylum that aims to harmonise the reception of asylum seekers in the EU [@EC_Pact_Migration_Asylum_2024]. One of the Pact's primary goals is to foster greater solidarity among the EU Member States [@sweeney2025eu] and address the disproportionate burden on border states that the existing Dublin regulation failed to resolve [@bansak2017europeans]. The new mandatory but flexible solidarity mechanism allows Member States to contribute via relocation of asylum seekers, as well financial or operational support.

Against this backdrop, understanding what drives public perceptions of fairness in migration and asylum policy becomes crucial. What is the fairest allocation of asylum seekers in the EU? To answer this question, people may combine several fairness principles, as described in traditional justice theories [e.g., @konow2003fairest]. However, when own-country stakes are salient, a self-serving bias can shift those judgements so that the option that benefits their country most appears "fairest," as illustrated in bargaining games [@babcock1995biased; @konow2000fair].

The aim of this study is to explore how Europeans rank alternative relocation mechanisms and to what extent their preferences are driven by anticipated consequences versus fairness principles. We use an experimental survey to ask respondents of eight EU countries to evaluate the fairness of different systems, while varying the type and availability of information about the consequences of each mechanism. This experimental design tests how fairness judgements respond to own-country expected asylum seekers intake, allowing us to detect self-serving shifts alongside more impartial fairness considerations.

Prior research has shown that a large majority of Europeans support mechanisms for redistributing asylum applications across EU countries, such as proportional relocation schemes based on country's population or economic capacity [@bansak2017europeans].  However, it is unclear to what extent such support is based on a principle of fairness or on self-interest, as citizens may view a proportional system as more advantageous for them regardless of fairness. It is also unclear how current perceptions are influenced by the available information, and how such information should be communicated or presented to citizens. This study advances the field by exploring if and to what extent public perceptions of fairness of different relocation systems are shaped by own-country consequences by varying the *type* of available information on the expected asylum seekers under each system.

To address these questions, our experimental survey asked respondents to rank fairness of three methods of allocating asylum seekers: no relocation, allocation proportional to each country's GDP, and allocation proportional to each country's population. We find that nearly three-quarters of participants find some form of relocation most fair. However, there are important country differences. These are consistent with a self-serving bias: the tendency to judge the method that results in relatively fewer asylum seekers in one's own country as fairer. Moreover, communication strategies randomised as treatments significantly moderate this tendency. Explicitly spelling out the likely consequences of implementation of each method in absolute terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected in participants' country per year) significantly strengthens the self-serving bias. The same information presented in relative terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected per 100,000 inhabitants), showing that the number of asylum seekers is generally small, has a weaker effect.

This work contributes to the literature on how public perceptions of fairness influence policy acceptance. Policy acceptance across all sectors depend on citizens viewing them as fair. Fairness judgements about who deserves what and perceptions about whether incomes reflect effort versus circumstances are strong correlates of redistributive preferences [@vanoorschot2000deservingness; @fong2001redistribution; @durante2014fairness; @cappelen2023tradeoff]  (Van Oorschot, 2000, 2006; Fong, 2001; Corneo & Grüner, 2002; Fong and Luttmer, 2011; Durante et al., 2014; Almås et al., 2020; Cappelen et al., 2022). Information can influence support, but its effects are heterogeneous: mobility information raises support (especially for opportunity policies), while inequality information mostly shifts concern and has large policy effects chiefly for the estate tax [...] (Kuziemko et al., 2015; Alesina et al., 2018). In climate policy, support for carbon pricing rises when revenues are allocated in ways seen as fair, and acceptance can be improved with clear and trustworthy information on policy's impact [@maestreandres2019carbon] (Carattini et al., 2019; Maestre-Andrés et al., 2019).

Our study also adds to the literature in behavioural economics and decision making that aims to understand how people respond to different ways of framing information. Work in medical research, for instance, has shown that people respond differently to risks when they are presented in absolute versus relative terms [] (Witte et al, 2021) . Our work bridges these insights from medical and behavioural science literature and embeds them within a migration policy context.

How do Europeans judge alternative relocation mechanisms? Are judgements driven primarily by antici-pated domestic consequences, or by solidarity and fairness principles? How do these perceptions vary across countries that, despite being similar in many respects, differ so widely in terms of economic ca-pacity and population size? Our study aims to address these questions via an experimental survey that asks citizens of eight EU countries to evaluate the fairness of different systems, while varying the type and availability of information about the consequences of each mechanism. This experimental design helps to disentangle concerns about outcomes from fairness.

Prior research has shown that a large majority of Europeans support mechanisms for redistributing asy-lum applications across EU countries, such as proportional relocation schemes based on country’s population or economic capacity (Bansak et al. (2017)). However, it is unclear to what extent such sup-port is based on a principle of fairness or on self –interest, as citizens may view a proportional system as more advantageous for them regardless of fairness. It is also unclear how current perceptions are influenced by the available information, and how such information should be communicated or presented to citizens. This study advances the field by exploring if and to what extent public perceptions of fairness of different relocation systems are shaped by own-country consequences (self-serving bias) by varying the type and amount of the available information on the expected asylum seekers under each system, .


To address these questions, our experimental survey asked respondents to rank fairness of three methods of allocating asylum seekers: no relocation, allocation proportional to each country’s GDP, and allocation proportional to each country’s population. We find that nearly three-quarters of participants find some form of relocation most fair. However, there are important country differences. These are con-sistent with a self-serving bias: the tendency to judge the method that results in relatively fewer asylum seekers in one’s own country as fairer. Moreover, communication strategies randomised as treatments significantly moderate this tendency. Explicitly spelling out the likely consequences of implementation of each method in absolute terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected in partici-pants’ country per year) significantly strengthens the self-serving bias. The same information presented in relative terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected per 100,000 inhabitants), showing that the number of asylum seekers is generally small, has a weaker effect.

Our study also adds to the literature in behavioural economics and decision making that aims to under-stand how people respond to different ways of framing information. Work in medical research, for in-stance, has shown that people respond differently to risks when they are presented in absolute versus relative terms. For example, research shows that patients are more likely to follow a prescribed cure when they are informed of relative risks (e.g. doubles your risk) rather than absolute risks (e.g., your risk is 2%) (REF). In medicine, these effects are often explained by people’s tendency to use heuristics (cognitive bias) or education, especially poor numerical literacy [REFs]. Our work bridges these insights from medical and behavioural science literature and embeds them within a migration policy context.

In this context, it is important to understand how communication of the information interact with political orientation, pre-defined beliefs about migration, knowledge or awareness of the migration system.
