# Introduction

Over the past decade, the EU's asylum and migration system has been severely tested, from the 2015 escalation of the Syrian war to the recent conflict in Ukraine. These events exposed a disproportionate pressure placed on border states. In response, the EU adopted the Pact on Migration and Asylum in May 2024, a legislative package aimed at creating a fairer, more efficient migration management system.

The pact establishes a permanent solidarity framework: the Member State of first entry remains responsible for asylum applications, while all Member States commit to support the system through solidarity contributions, including relocations of applicants or beneficiaries, financial contributions, or other operational support [@eu2024pact]. However, not all countries agree on how the burden should be shared.

In this context, understanding public perceptions of fairness and solidarity in the EU asylum and migration system is crucial for ensuring the solidarity framework functions effectively and social cohesion is maintained across the EU.

Research shows that, when judging distributional outcomes, people tend to combine several fairness principles, such as need, deserviness, reciprocity, equal claims, or capacity. [@konow2003fairest]. However, when own-stakes are salient, a self-serving bias can shift those judgements so that the option that benefits agents the most appears "fairest" [@babcock1995biased; @konow2000fair]. This tension between "distributional fairness" and "self-serving tendency" appears particularly relevant when considering international solidarity in the asylum system. On the one hand, the principle of fairness suggests that countries should share migrants proportionally to their capacity. On the other, self-serving biases may lead to prioritise national interest. However, despite pioneering work by @bansak2017europeans to understand this issue, how these views shape public perceptions of fairness in the migration system is still poorly understood.

Prior research has shown that a large majority of Europeans support mechanisms for redistributing asylum applications across EU countries, such as proportional relocation schemes based on country's population or economic capacity [@bansak2017europeans]. However, it is unclear to what extent such support is based on a principle of fairness or on self -interest, as citizens may view a proportional system as more advantageous for them regardless of fairness. It is also unclear how current perceptions are influenced by the available information, and how such information should be communicated or presented to citizens. This study advances the field by exploring if and to what extent public perceptions of fairness of different relocation systems are shaped by own-country consequences by varying the *type* of available information on the expected asylum seekers under each system.

To address these questions, we conducted an experimental survey to ask respondents of eight EU countries to evaluate the fairness of different systems, while varying the type and availability of information about the consequences of each mechanism. The experimental survey asked respondents to rank fairness of three methods of allocating asylum seekers: no relocation, allocation proportional to each country's GDP, and allocation proportional to each country's population. As in @bansak2017europeans, we compared responses from those who received information about the consequence of implementing each method for the respondent's country, against those with no such information. However, we also varied how such information was shown by presenting it in _absolute_ versus _per capita_ terms.  

<!--This experimental design tests how fairness judgements respond to own-country expected asylum seekers intake, allowing us to detect self-serving shifts alongside more impartial fairness considerations. Specifically, t-->

We find that nearly three-quarters of participants find some form of relocation most fair. However, there are important country differences. These are consistent with a self-serving bias: the tendency to judge the method that results in relatively fewer asylum seekers in one's own country as fairer. Moreover, communication strategies randomised as treatments significantly moderate this tendency. Explicitly spelling out the likely consequences of implementation of each method in absolute terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected in participants' country per year) significantly strengthens the self-serving bias. The same information presented in relative terms (how many thousands of asylum seekers are to be expected per 100,000 inhabitants), showing that the number of asylum seekers is generally small, has a weaker effect.

This work contributes to the literature on how public perceptions of fairness influence policy acceptance. Policy acceptance across all sectors depend on citizens viewing them as fair. Fairness judgements about who deserves what and perceptions about whether incomes reflect effort versus circumstances are strong correlates of redistributive preferences (Van Oorschot, 2000, 2006; Fong, 2001; Corneo & Grüner, 2002; Fong and Luttmer, 2011; Durante et al., 2014; Almås et al., 2020; Cappelen et al., 2022). Information can influence support, but its effects are heterogeneous: mobility information raises support (especially for opportunity policies), while inequality information mostly shifts concern and has large policy effects chiefly for the estate tax (Kuziemko et al., 2015; Alesina et al., 2018). In climate policy, support for carbon pricing rises when revenues are allocated in ways seen as fair, and acceptance can be improved with clear and trustworthy information on policy's impact (Carattini et al., 2019; Maestre-Andrés et al., 2019).

Our study also adds to the literature in behavioural economics and decision making that aims to understand how people respond to different ways of framing information. Work in medical research, for instance, has shown that people respond differently to risks when they are presented in absolute versus relative terms (Witte et al, 2021) . Our work bridges these insights from medical and behavioural science literature and embeds them within a migration policy context.
