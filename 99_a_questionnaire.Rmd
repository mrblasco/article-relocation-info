PROG: create 3 equal groups: create hidden variable ‘relocation_treatment’, according to least fill quota per country. Assign each participant to one of these 3 groups. For group 2 and 3 extra info is to be shown in Q13: 
1.	Control 
2.	Absolute 
3.	Relative 
 

Q14. [S] Below you see three scenarios describing how asylum applicants could be distributed across the EU. <IF TREATED: The numbers are based on national statistics.> In your view, what would be a fair way to establish the number of asylum applicants per country? Please rank the three options from the fairest to the least fair one.  
<fair_number_applications> 
 
1.	No relocation: Applications should be handled in the country of first entry (that is, asylum seekers are required to submit their asylum application in the European country in which they initially arrive).  
PROG: show for relocation_treatment =2: ‘This would mean approximately <Bold: X1> asylum applications allocated to [COUNTRY] on average per year.’  
PROG: show for relocation_treatment =3: ‘This would mean approximately <Bold: Y1> applications allocated to [COUNTRY] per 100,000 of its citizens on average per year.’ <no_relocation_preferred> 
2.	Proportional to population: The number of applications should be proportional to the country’s population.  
PROG: show for relocation_treatment =2: ‘This would mean approximately <Bold: X2>asylum applications allocated to [COUNTRY] on average per year.’  
PROG: show for relocation_treatment =3: ‘This would mean approximately <Bold: Y2> applications allocated to [COUNTRY] per 100,000 of its citizens on average per year.’ <relocation_population_preferred> 
3.	Proportional to the country’s economy: The number of applications should be proportional to the country’s GDP.  
PROG: show for relocation_treatment =2: ‘This would mean approximately <Bold: X3>asylum applications allocated to [COUNTRY] on average per year.’  
PROG: show for relocation_treatment =3: ‘This would mean approximately <Bold: Y3> applications allocated to [COUNTRY] per 100,000 of its citizens on average per year.’ <relocation_GDP_preferred> 
PROG: replace value <X1-X2-X3> and <Y1-Y2-Y3> by country specific numbers (see xls file) 
Scripter: Please keep Q14 and Q15 on same page.  
 

Q15. Could you please briefly explain why you ranked the options the way you did? What influenced your choice? 
PROG: create 3 random groups (completely random, no least fill quota): create hidden variable ‘scenario’. Assign each participant to one of these 3 groups. Different info shown in Q16 depending on group: 
1.	fair 
2.	unfair 
3.	unfair_more 
 
Q16. [SLIDER] Imagine a hypothetical situation where <if Scenario=1 or 2, show: ‘200,000’ if Scenario=3, show ‘300,000’> refugees from a non-EU country need to be resettled across three EU countries <PROG: show: ‘([countryX], [countryY], and [COUNTRY])>. The refugees are initially distributed as follows: 
PROG: show for Treat Scenario=1 (Fair Distribution):  
* [countryX]: 55,000 refugees 
* [countryY]: 45,000 refugees 
 
PROG: show for Treat Scenario=2 (Less Fair Distribution):  
* [countryX]: 85,000 refugees 
* [countryY]: 15,000 refugees 
 
PROG: show for Treat Scenario=3 (Less Fair, More Refugees) 
* [countryX]: 135,000 refugees 
* [countryY]: 65,000 refugees 
 
Based on the scenario: how many of the remaining 100,000 refugees would you be willing to accept in [COUNTRY]? If you select a number less than 100,000, the remaining amount will be evenly distributed between the other two countries. <number_accepted_refugees> 
 
[INSERT SLIDER ranging from 0 to 100,000, in steps of 5000, show value of selected point] 
 
PROG: replace [countryX] and [countryY] with random pairs from {Romania, Belgium, Austria, Czech Republic}, store the country shown in variable countryX and countryY: 
 
Pair 	CountryX 	CountryY 
1 	Romania 	Belgium
